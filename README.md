## ❗Not actively maintained❗
Maybe some of the [forks](https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/network/members) are better maintained than this repo. I unfortunately don't have the time to support it.

# BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD
It is a standalone plugin for the free, open source CAD tool
[FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD). The aim is it to integrate
collaboration in the BIM space through support of the [BCF (BIM Collaboration Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIM_Collaboration_Format). 

# Install

There are two options on how you can install the plugin: 

  - the "automatic" way, which utilizes the Addon-Manager of FreeCAD
  - the manual way where you will have to clone or download the whole repository
    and create two symbolic links

## Addon-Manager

To install the plugin through FreeCAD's Addon-Manager: open `FreeCAD` -> `Tools` -> `Addon manager` -> Select `BCFPlugin` -> Press
`Install/Update selected`

## Manual

To use the plugin, in its current state in FreeCAD, clone it to some directory of your liking. To be able to import the modules/packages of the plugin we need to symlink the source folder (`bcfplugin`) to your FreeCAD Mod directory and also create a symlink for the BCFPlugin.FCMacro file in the FreeCAD Macro directory.
```bash
$> git clone git@github.com:podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD.git /path/to/repo/dir
$> ln -s /path/to/repo/dir/bcfplugin "$HOME"/.FreeCAD/Mod/BCFPlugin
$> ln -s /path/to/repo/dir/bcfplugin/BCFPlugin.FCMacro "$HOME"/.FreeCAD/Macro/
```

# Dependencies
Following you will find a list of non standard python modules that might have to be installed 
manually:

- [python-dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/)
- [xmlschema](https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/)
- [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)
- [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip)

I reccommend installing these packages inside a [python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). To 
create one in the current directory, and subsequently activate it, execute:

```bash
$> python3 -m venv <NAME>
$> source ./<NAME>/bin/activate
```


# Usage
All source code is contained in the directory [./bcfplugin/](https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/tree/feature/PI_retrieval/bcfplugin). 
To import it in FreeCAD run the following command in the `Python Console`:

```python
>>> import bcfplugin
```

`bcfpluin/` contains a `__init__.py` which, upon import, checks whether the dependencies are satisfied. 

## Making FreeCAD aware of Virtual Environment

If you have installed the dependencies in a python virtual environment, FreeCAD is likely to not be aware of it. Thus you probably also got some error messages in the `Report View`. To make FreeCAD aware of the packages installed in the python virtual environment you have to execute the following steps: 

  1. Get a path to the directory in which you installed the virtual environment.
  2. Find out which python version FreeCAD is using, in my case it is `python3.6`.
  3. Check that the following path exists, relative to the root directory of you virtual environment. If it does not exist, maybe you have installed the packages for a different version of python than FreeCAD is using.
    
```
/path/to/venv/lib/python[VERSION]/site-packages
```  
  4. In the `Python console` you have to append to `sys.path` the above mentioned path like this:
    ```python
    import sys
    sys.path.append("VENV/lib/python[VERSION]/site-packages
    ```
    
## Using the non-GUI frontend
To get access to the nonGUI-frontend (also called programmatic interface or PI for short) the import of `bcfplugin` suffices. 
```python
>>> import bcfplugin as plugin
```
This imports all necessary functions into the plugin global namespace from `programmaticInterface.py`, thereby making them easily accessible.

Without a BCF file, however, the plugin is of little value, thus let's open a BCF file: 
```python
>>> plugin.openProject("/path/to/bcf/file.bcf")
```
**Note**: If you use a file that does not comply with the standard, then you will see some error messages in the `Report view`. These notify you about the fact that a particular file could not be validated successfully against the corresponding XSD-(XML Schema Definition)File. For every non valid file one error message is printed. A more detailed version of the errors, specifying which node exactly did not comply, can be found in the log file. The path of the log file will be printed before any of these error messages are displayed. 

But that doesn't have to concern you right now. Every node that does not comply with the standard is simply not read into the internal data model. That means you can't modify it, but still can add/update/delete to/from the model. 

To read all available topics, ordered by index run:

```python
>>> plugin.getTopics()
```

This function returns you a list of tuples. Each tuple does contain the title of the topic as first element, the second element is a reference to the topic object itself. These references are important, so save them in a variable like: 

```python 
>>> topics = [ topic[1] for topic in plugin.getTopics() ]
```

You might also want to view all comments in chronological order, related with one topic, say the first one in the list: 

```python
>>> plugin.getComments(topics[0])
```

As it was the case with the topics, `getComments()` also returns a list of tuples, here the first element is the comment itself with the name of the creator, the date of creation and the date of last modification.

But comments alone would be pretty boring, so you can retrieve a list of viewpoints associated with a given topic with

```python
>>> plugin.getViewpoints(topics[0])
```

Again, you receive a list of tuples. Apart from the reference to the viewpoint object, you get the file name of the viewpoint as first element of the tuple. 
There might be cases where you just want to view comments that are linked to certain viewpoints in a topic. To generate a list like this run:

```python
>>> viewpoints = [ vp[1] for vp in plugin.getViewpoints(topic[0]) ]
>>> plugin.getComments(topic[0], viewpoints[0])
```

In a topic might also be some IFC project files listed that the topic is associated with. You can review a list of these with: 
```python
>>> plugin.getRelevantIfcFiles(topics[0])
```

And to get a list of related documents the function `getAdditionalDocumentReferences()` is the one for you: 

```python
>>> plugin.getAdditionalDocumentReferences(topics[0])
```

You might have noticed by now that the topic is a rather important object, so treat it with care!
If you stumble upon a member `id` in any object you retrieved from the plugin, don't modify it. The plugin uses this member to uniquely identify objects in the data model!

## Using the GUI frontend

To start the plugin in GUI mode inside FreeCAD go to `Macro -> Macros`. In the newly opened window you should see a list entry called "BCFPlugin". To start either double click this entry or select it and then click on `Execute` on the right hand side. 

This will present you with a, at first, rather blank application consisting of just two buttons: `Open` and `Create`. With the first button an existing BCF file can be opened, the second button creates a new BCF file, although at first in the working directory only. For a complete tutorial on the plugin's GUI please visit the [Tutorials/GUI](https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/wiki/GUI-Tutorial) on the [wiki page](https://github.com/podestplatz/BCF-Plugin-FreeCAD/wiki/)


## Debugging

Per default only messages of the categories: Info, Warning, Error and Critical make it to the report view, but are logged in the log file, however. If you also want to view every single debug message to the report view you have to do two things: 
 - ensure that "logging" is enabled in the report view by clicking with the right mouse button somewhere in the view -> Options -> logging (there should be a checkmark besides it)
 - change the following line from INFO to DEBUG:
 ```python
 def getFreeCADHandler():
 ...
    - handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    + handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
 ...
 ```
